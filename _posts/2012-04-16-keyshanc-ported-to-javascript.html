This post demonstrates how to use the [Keyshanc Javascript](https://github.com/Networc/keyshanc/tree/master/javascript). Type your Keyshanc password in the password field and press the "Keyshanc" button. If you want to disable Keyshanc, delete all text from the password field and press the "Keyshanc" button again.<br />
<h3>Examples</h3>
Use "aragorn" as the Keyshanc password and paste the following into the "Input" text box:<br />
<pre><code>&amp;TxJYUT$J1}JFKUT$J18xDJmqqJmT(JUTJ18xJ(mK/TxzzJFUT(J18xD</code></pre><br />
Use "bilbo" as the Keyshanc password and paste the following into the "Input" text box:<br />
<pre><code>7Ao!4KA'!&lt;E!zdKA'!&lt;Roa!P55!PA^!KA!&lt;Ro!^PdpAoVV!zKA^!&lt;Roa</code></pre><br />
