As recent news surrounding SOPA and CISPA have pushed privacy to the forefront of our national discourse, and as rebellions against oppressive governments continue to rage in other countries, several services promoting "privacy" for social media are hoping to capitalize on this rising fear and mistrust. Two such sites are <a href="https://scrambls.com/">scrambls</a> and <a href="https://priv.ly/">Privly</a>. Both sites employ different technical approaches to achieve a similar goal: limit access to social media postings to those individuals that you specify.

In light of this political fervor at home and crackdowns on political activists abroad, I think that it is imperative that we consider the following:

1. If a privacy service requires a connection to their servers in order to encrypt and decrypt, could a country such as Syria, Iran, or China block the entire service, rendering it useless for their citizens?
2. Could these privacy services be subpoenaed to produce a user's decrypted messages?
3. Could these privacy services be shutdown by the government if it finds them to be politically disagreeable?
4. If \(when?\) hacked, will every decrypted message be posted on WikiLeaks?
5. If a privacy service shuts down, will its users be able to retrieve their old postings?

In my opinion, by choosing one of these services the user is merely transferring their personal responsibility to ensure their own privacy to a 3rd party. With Keyshanc, though, it's just you and those you trust.

No reliance on any<i>one</i> or any<i>thing</i>.
