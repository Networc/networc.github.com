<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This is the personal website and blog of <a href="http://andrewcreed.com/about.html">Andrew C. Reed</a>.</p>
<p>All current content deals with <a href="http://andrewcreed.com/2012/04/04/keyshanc-overview.html">Keyshanc</a> (KEYboard SHA-based eNCrypter), which is my attempt to thwart keyloggers on workstations where the user cannot install software. Keyshanc is open source - please +1 and Tweet (#keyshanc) about it if you feel that it advances web security.</p>
<p>Over time, I will continue to add my future open source projects and blog about them. Thanks for visiting!</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<p><b>3 May 2012:</b> I have created a new home for Keyshanc that demonstrates full integration with Twitter. Please visit it <a href="http://andrewcreed.com/keyshanc/">here</a>.</p>
